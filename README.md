# MINIMI – Masterplan

## App Overview and Objectives

**MINIMI** is a universal matching platform that intelligently connects users for meaningful interactions — whether for romance, professional networking, or shared activities. Unlike traditional apps that rely on static profiles or shallow criteria, MINIMI uses dynamic data and AI-assisted logic to create compatible matches with personalized guidance and context.

## Target Audience

MINIMI serves two core user roles:

1. **Event Attendees (Connectors)**  
   - People looking to make meaningful connections through curated events
   - Their intentions can vary:
     - Romantic connection
     - Professional networking
     - Shared hobbies or local activities

2. **Event Organizers (Hosts)**  
   - Individuals or organizations that host events and want participants to be intelligently matched
   - Use cases include:
     - Dating events
     - Speed networking
     - Local event meetups or clubs
     - Internal corporate events

Both groups share one platform experience. Users may participate in events or become organizers by publishing one.

## Core Features and Functionality

### User Profile System
- Basic demographic info, location, and preferences
- Multi-language support
- Profile privacy controls

### Event Explorer
- Public browsing of events by location, tags, or type
- Events can be romantic, professional, or casual

### Event Creation (Organizer Mode)
- Any user can become an organizer by publishing an event
- Supports multiple match rounds
- Custom questionnaires for participants

### Organizer Insights and Management Tools

Event organizers gain access to an **Organizer Dashboard** with tools to manage attendees and better understand group dynamics — while respecting participant privacy.

**Key Organizer Features:**
- View anonymized stats about event participants:
  - Age distribution
  - Gender mix
  - Top shared interests or tags
  - Summary of match feedback (e.g., "60% of matches were rated positive")
- Track:
  - Total signups
  - Completed questionnaires
  - Match completion per round
- Export anonymized reports (e.g., for business partners or future planning)
- Optional: AI-generated summary of event compatibility trends
- Organizers cannot view:
  - Individual match scores
  - Private profile answers
  - Direct participant identities unless match is accepted by both sides

**Privacy Safeguards:**
- Only aggregated data is shown
- Personal information is redacted or anonymized
- Organizers must agree to data use policy
- Admin oversight included for auditing/reporting tools

### AI-Powered Matching
- Hard filters (e.g. gender, city) using Supabase/Postgres
- Soft matching using OpenAI to assess compatibility
- Match reasoning + conversation starter generated by LLM

### Conversation Assistance
- Icebreakers per match
- Optional memory system for future conversation cues (planned)

### Feedback Loop
- Thumbs up/down post-match
- Feedback reason (e.g., "bad vibe" or "too far")
- Future matching model can adapt based on aggregate feedback

### Multi-platform Support
- Responsive web app (desktop + mobile)
- iOS/Android native apps (future)

## High-Level Technical Stack Recommendations

- **Frontend:** Vite + React + TypeScript + shadcn-ui + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Edge Functions)
- **Auth:** Supabase Auth (email/phone only, LinkedIn OAuth planned)
- **AI Engine:** OpenAI API (for matching logic and reasoning)
- **CMS (optional):** Notion (for landing/help content)

## Conceptual Data Model (MVP)

- **users** – Authenticated identities
- **profiles** – Personal info, preferences, location
- **events** – Events with time, tags, and matching rounds
- **event_questions** – Custom forms per event
- **event_participants** – Tracks responses and join status
- **matches** – Stores matched pairs, score, reasoning, icebreaker
- **match_feedback** – Post-match reactions and reasons
- **event_insights** (optional) – Aggregated data for organizers

## User Interface Design Principles

- Clean, minimalist layout with a slightly playful vibe
- Responsive, mobile-first design
- Grid-based content presentation (especially for events)
- Accessible typography and contrast
- Friendly tone with subtle animations

## Security Considerations

- End-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Supabase auth rules and row-level security
- Granular privacy settings per user
- Admin moderation tools for event/content review
- GDPR-compliant data handling
- Support for "right to be forgotten" and data export

## Development Phases or Milestones

### Phase 1 – MVP (Foundational Matching Platform)
- User profiles, event creation, join flow
- Matching via basic filters + OpenAI scoring
- Feedback system
- Core admin tools

### Phase 2 – Event Ticketing System (Phased Approach)

#### **Phase 2.1 – Free Ticket System**
- Design and implement ticketing tables in Supabase (see schema in this repo).
- Allow organizers to enable ticketing for their events and set ticket limits.
- Users can reserve a free ticket for an event (no payment required).
- Track ticket reservations in the database (`event_ticket`, `ticket_type`, and `event_ticket_setting` tables).
- Show ticket status (reserved/full) on event and profile pages.
- Export list of ticket holders for organizers.
- Enforce per-user and per-type ticket limits in the app logic.
- Set up RLS (Row Level Security) policies so users can only see/manage their own tickets.

#### **Phase 2.2 – Stripe Integration for Paid Tickets**
- Integrate Stripe with Supabase for payment processing ([Supabase Stripe integration guide](https://medium.com/@ojasskapre/implementing-stripe-subscriptions-with-supabase-next-js-and-fastapi-666e1aada1b5#:~:text=,create%20a%20Stripe%20Checkout%20session)).
- Add price fields to ticket types and support paid ticket types.
- When a user selects a paid ticket, create a Stripe Checkout session and redirect the user to complete payment.
- On successful payment, update the ticket status in Supabase and issue the ticket.
- Handle payment webhooks to confirm ticket issuance and manage refunds/cancellations.
- Display payment status and receipts to users.

#### **Phase 2.3 – Ticket Discounting System**
- Add discount code support to the ticketing system (see [Stripe Discounts documentation](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/checkout/discounts?payment-ui=embedded-components#:~:text=match%20at%20L308%20On%20your,parameter%20in%20a%20Checkout%20Session)).
- Allow organizers to create and manage discount codes for their events.
- Users can enter a discount code at checkout; validate and apply the code to reduce the ticket price.
- Enforce discount code usage limits, expiration, and eligibility in both Supabase and Stripe.
- Track which tickets were purchased with which discount codes for reporting.
- Show applied discounts and final prices in the UI and receipts.



### Phase 3 – Data & AI Enhancements

#### **Phase 3.1 – LinkedIn Sign-In and Profile Enrichment**
- Add LinkedIn OAuth as a sign-in option (alongside email/phone).
- On sign-in, fetch and store user's LinkedIn profile data (name, headline, photo, etc.) in the database.
- Use LinkedIn data to enrich user profiles and improve matching.
- (Optional) Show LinkedIn badge or info on user profile cards.

#### **Phase 3.2 – Match Enhancements**
- Memory system for profiles and past chats
- Adaptive scoring using feedback data
- Deeper compatibility insights

### Phase 4 – Community and Engagement Features
- Group matching options
- Video introductions or in-app video chat
- Gamification (e.g., badges for engaged users)
- Integration with calendars or social platforms

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Potential Solution |
|----------|---------------------|
| Cold start / no matches | Loosen soft filters + notify nearby compatible users |
| OpenAI cost management | Cache match results; use batching logic |
| User abuse or spam | Content flagging, rate limits, admin approval for events |
| Language diversity | Translate key UI and profile fields using i18n setup |

## Future Expansion Possibilities

- Strengthen core matching algorithm as key product differentiator
- Integrate with 3rd-party identity platforms (e.g., LinkedIn) to enrich profiles and improve match quality with less user input
- Develop APIs so external event platforms can plug into MINIMI's matching system
- Native mobile apps (iOS + Android)
- Personality-based compatibility using psychometric models (e.g., Big Five)
- Calendar integrations and in-app scheduling tools

# MINIMI – Design Guidelines

## Visual Style

### 🎨 Colors
- **Primary:** `#1D1D1F` (deep charcoal) – for strong contrast and text
- **Accent:** `#6C5CE7` (soft violet) – for buttons, highlights, and branding
- **Backgrounds:** 
  - White (`#FFFFFF`) – for clarity and contrast
  - Warm light gray (`#FAFAFA`) – for section separation

### 🔠 Font
- **Inter** – clean, modern, legible on all screen sizes

### 🧩 Components
- Card-based design for user profiles, events, and matches
- Subtle shadows and large rounded corners (e.g., `rounded-2xl`) for a soft, modern feel
- Hover/active states with gentle animation (opacity, scale, or color tint)


## Layout & UX Principles

### 📱 Mobile-First Design
- Interfaces should be touch-friendly, stacked vertically
- Core actions (sign up, create event, join match) easily accessible at bottom of screen
- Responsive grid for desktop users with max width for readability

### 🧭 Navigation
- Simple and predictable: Home, Events, My Events, Matches, Profile
- Onboarding should progressively reveal features (e.g., match engine only after joining an event)
- Persistent nav bar or bottom tab bar for mobile


## Accessibility

- High contrast for all text/button combinations
- Text resizes cleanly at 200% zoom
- Keyboard navigable wherever possible
- Clear labels for all form fields and buttons


## Brand Tone & Voice

- **Tone:** Friendly minimalism — informative without trying too hard
- **Voice Characteristics:**
  - Warm, but not overly casual
  - Helpful, but never robotic
  - Encouraging, not pushy

**Examples:**
- Instead of "You must complete this to proceed" → "Let's finish this step together"
- Instead of "No results found" → "Looks like there's nothing here right now — try adjusting your filters!"


## Animations & Transitions

- Use Framer Motion or Tailwind transitions for:
  - Match card reveals
  - Button states
  - Event filtering
- Keep animations under 300ms — smooth, never distracting


## Page & Form Design

- Forms should feel light and scannable
  - Group related fields with spacing
  - Use smart defaults (e.g., country from browser location)
- Avoid modals for critical flows (e.g., matching, joining events)
- Use skeleton loaders while fetching data


## Iconography & Visual Aids

- Use clear, friendly icons from a unified set (e.g., Lucide or Heroicons)
- Show avatars for profiles, not initials or generic icons
- Use emojis sparingly — mainly in onboarding or empty states


## Design Inspiration

- Stripe (clean, developer-friendly layouts)
- Notion (friendly tone and clean structure)
- Airbnb (event and location-driven UX)
